		<h2>Population</h2>
		<img src="Population.jpg" class="img-A"><p>Ireland is a quite nice nation located on the Island of Ireland west of Great Britain. It has a population of 5,224,884, with the densest population pocket in the counties of Leinster and Munster. Dublin is the largest pocket, located in Munster. 63.9% of the population live in an urban area. It has a growth rate of .97, which means it is actually shrinking, not growing; This is illustrated in the number of children per woman on average, which is 1.93. The average age of someone in Ireland is 37.8-year-old, and there is about an equal number of woman and men. The average life expectancy is 81.45 years, and the maternal mortality rate is 5 in every 100,000. The total death rate is 6.72 per 1,000. Most people are educated for about 20 years. People have a median income of $8,048 a month. About 5.92% of the population is unemployed. About 8.185% of Irish land in urban, with the rest being rural. </p>

			<h2>Cultural Geography</h2>
			<img src="Culture.jpg" class="img-A" height="300px"><p>Ireland is a Nation composed mostly of ethnic Irish. There are a few Irish Travelers, other Whites, Asians, blacks, and unspecified. The country is also a very equal place, as there were equality acts passed that mandate sexual equality. It is quite globalized as a culture, however there is still pride in Irish culture. Potatoes are used widely in Irish cuisine. Cabbage, Lamb and Mutton are also used in many things. There are not really many religious or cultural beliefs that have shaped their food choices, besides historically exporting most of the more desirable foods to England. English and Irish Gaelic are the National languages and also the most spoken languages. The Irish are also mostly catholic (at least in the south) with the Church of Ireland (Protestant), the orthodox church, and Muslims making up a much smaller percentage. The biggest religious sites are cathedrals and monasteries, with St. Patrick’s Cathedral being one of the most visited. The culture of Ireland overall is very interesting. There is a mix of Catholic, Celtic, and colonized sentiments. There is a little animosity towards the British, but mostly there is just a continuation of the Catholic Celtic culture that has manifested itself for many centuries. They as a people are also not afraid to take up arms and deal with a problem, specifically occupation.<br /><br/>
			Ireland is cursed with British weather. It tends to be Mild, humid, and rainy. It has very mountainous terrain, on the west coast and in the north. It is flat plains good for farming and grazing otherwise. People live in Leister and Munster because that’s where the farming and livable land is. They are also on the east coast because it is closer to Great Britain. Most tourists tend to go to these populated areas, with excursions out to the country side. The Irish people who inhabit the Island currently seem to have come from the Iberian Peninsula hundreds of years ago. One of the biggest points of Irish history is getting kicked around by the British. From the way they messed with the Irish kingdoms in the dark ages, to the settlement of Northern Ireland by British Protestants, to the full-on colonization, to the rising revolution, civil war and troubles. Britain has been a large driving factor behind Irelands history. There are many other things that affect the country slightly though, Cultural diffusion is the spread of the culture, and the only main way that that is being done right now is through the processes of globalization. There is the possibility for creolization but most of the citizens or Ireland keep Gaelic and English apart. People would either go to Ireland to see the natural beauty of its mountains and other landscapes, or possibly to learn more about the land their ancestors came from. This gives us reason to believe that the most visited spots would be historic sites and natural wonders

			<h2>Politics</h2>
			<img src="IrishPolotic.jpg" class="img-A" height="300px"><p>Well, Irelands a very funny place. It’s a strange and a troubled land. This journey started 900 years ago, and lasted for 800 of those years. The earlier years (pre-1800) saw a few rebellions, but nothing large enough to remove the British completely from the isle. In 1798 there was a large Irish rebellion. This directly led to the British cracked down in 1800, which merged the Irish and British. This went on for a long while, and during that time many injustices and mismanagements happened, especially during the potato famine. This all culminated in the Easter Rising, which took place in 1916. During the Rising, 1,250 people in Dublin and 2,000-3,000 else where rose up and took British assets. The others spread throughout the country did not really see much combat, but for 5 days Dublin was occupied by Rebels. One of the most iconic events was the raising of the Irish tricolor flag on the GPO or general post office. The soldiers fought valiantly, but less showed up than expected, and they failed. The British, however, unwisely executed many of the leaders, which sparked a thought in the minds of many Irishmen. They thought that maybe, just maybe those people died for something during the rising. And that directly led to the revolution in 1919 which continued until 1921 when the Irish won the fight for home rule, and became a nation once again. <br /><br/>

There have been two major challenges to Irish sovereignty. The first is the Irish civil war, which spanned the time from a little after the revolution had ended, and continued until mid-1923. This saw the new government of Ireland pitted against people who opposed the treaty which gave Ireland home rule, because they wanted to be fully independent. This saw many of the paramilitary forces that worked to create this new Irish state turn against it. The British supported the pro-treaty government with material. It started witch fierce fighting, but ended as anti-treaty politicians gained power and politically moved away from England, forging its own path. <br/><br/>

For those wondering, I would not consider the Troubles a threat to Irish sovereignty.  This was because it only took place in the north, and was really only concerned with the north. While it did see British troops on northern Irish land, the Irish worked with British in containing the situation.  <br/><br/>

There are a couple minorities in Ireland, Irish Travelers, Protestants, and I guess Muslims. There are very small amounts of people in these groups however, and there is no push to unify the country because it is pretty much unified culturally. Ireland is one nation which no other nations in it. It is also a compact state, meaning that most of the sides are equidistant from the center. Its northern and only land border is open and free to cross; however, there are defiantly border emplacements in certain areas. There are no large internal boundaries; however, there is a boundary in the north that did not used to be there. There are no exclaves, and this country is not land locked. Ireland has a unitary government, and it is broken up into providences. It is a Democracy, with the Dáil and possibly the GPO being important government landmarks. A fairly large centripetal force that pops up from time to time is the proposition of uniting Ireland and Northern Ireland together. It is 169th on the fragile state index with spike of 2012 and 2014.  They fall at number 20 on the corruption index with a score of 72. They are part of the European Union, UN, Interpol, IOC, UNESCO. </p><br/><p class="hide">.</p>

			<h2>Agricultural and Rural Land Use Patterns and Processes</h2>
			<img src="Agriculture.jpg" class="img-A"><p>Ireland is a more Developed Country. The most exported produce is Barley, Sugar beets, and Wheat. The average food cost per week in €57. The Irish east lots of red meat, veggies, pasta and chicken. Potatoes are most likely eaten a lot still to, however. I would expect most of the food eaten is Irish grown. The Irish are also a large exporter of Food Ireland is also very, very stable in its food production.  Monocrop farming and substance farming were also practiced at one point, a long time ago. Farming first came about in Ireland in around 4500 BC. Barley, cattle and fish were among the first things farmed. They are on the bleeding edge of agricultural technology. They also placed first on the Food security index..</p><br/><br/><p class="hide">.</p>

			<h2>Industry</h2>
			<img src="Industry.jpg" class="img-A" height="200px"><p>Ireland is very rural place, as such there is not a lot of industry. Most of their industry is in Ulster, which is technically in Northern Ireland, as this was where the British sent people to many centuries ago. The rest of Ireland was designated basically as farmland, so it is not developed. Dublin is the most industrialized place in Ireland.</p><br/><br/><p class="hide">.</p>
