	<h2>Internships</h2>
	<p>My Internship was with KnightSmith Games. During my internship I had a 2 main jobs. My 1st job consisted of compiling digital art packs to be sold on their online store. The 2nd job was more about using the actual toolkit. I designed virtual Tabletop maps based on provided blueprints using the Masters Toolkit software. 
This Internship was impactful to me as it allowed me to see that Game design is a much vaster field than most people originally think. The People at Arkenforge who made the Masters Toolkit, and my mentor at KnightSmith, both could fall under the role as a game designer, each in their own aspects. It also furthered my commitment to becoming a game designer.<br/><br/>
Most of the projects I worked on were virtual maps created for a tabletop game called Pathfinder, which was originally designed by Paizo.  These maps were both simple and complex to recreate. When I started on the maps I moved rather slowly as I was still trying to get my bearings for the program. I say “both simple and complex to recreate” because while some of the bigger details like trees and rocks are just clicked right in, there are more details along the ground and in the environment that aren’t premade objects. I ended up having to hand draw a lot of vines and grass patches so that the map would have the right feel to it. After managing to get the environments down correctly, I was then tasked to start making the buildings. Buildings added further complexity by requiring me to have precise measurements in some areas where the artists didn’t follow the grid strictly and did more freestyle. One particular example of this was in the Vault of thorns map, where the artists had designed a staircase that’s railing was almost vine-like in the way it curved. I ended up having to freehand this part, and as I am not a super good artist, ended up remaking it several times. <br/><br/>
There were also other parts of maps where neither free handing nor a prefab model was an option. The main example of this is in the map The Insane Dwarf, in which there was a rounded tent with some ropes tying it down to the ground. Due to my lack of artistry skills, on top of the fact that none of the tent models matched the one I was looking for, I ended up having to get creative with it. I ended up using some wood as the rope texture as it was thin enough it just came off as a brown texture, and had a hot air balloon as the actual tent. Normally this probably wouldn’t have worked, however It actually matched the original design rather well.<br/><br/>
The final map I worked on before my internship ended was the Redlake fort. This map was huge, and was definitely a leap given I had mostly worked with environments beforehand, and I only got partway through another building map. By the end of my internship I hadn’t even completed the majority of the map, only making through the first few sections. The reason I didn’t get super far with it was mostly down to its complexity. There was a lot of new tricks that I had to learn while making this particular map like double checking the maps description versus its drawing, doing proper sizing on all pieces, getting layering done correctly, and more. Me having a difficult time wasn’t really that bad of a thing, as I ended up asking a lot of questions about how to effectively use the software. One of the hardest parts for this map, like the others, was free-handing parts. There was a section in the map where the terrain around the fort had crumbled down, and I couldn’t really follow the grid that was in place to make it. There was also a lot of rocky cliff around the entire fort that all needed to be freehanded. I do feel by the end of this I definitely improved my ability to freehand some parts of the designs, instead of just using the line tools.<br /><br/>
Overall, I feel this internship experience has helped me learn more about some of the lesser known aspects of the game design world, and has helped me with some of the more creative sides of it as well. I still plan on going into the game design field, and I hope the experiences I’ve had with this internship will help me later in life when pursuing this field

   <h2>Career Exploration Report</h2>

<p>
The first career is mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is engineering that involves anything that moves or rotates. Due to this it is arguably on of the most broad and important types of engineering, and ranges from aerospace to nanotech, biotech to robotics. This field of engineering focuses on creating technologies to meet human needs. Each field strives to solve problems related to that field and make improvement to that field. <br />.<br />
	

Mechanical engineers spend their days designing, prototyping, and creating different machines. Due to the broadness of the field, this is about as complex you can get when giving a general description of all mechanical engineering.  If you specialize in a certain field, you will be designing, prototyping, and creating things specific to the field you went into. Mechanical engineers need to be fluent with the tools and programs used, which is where the education comes in.<br />.<br />


When going into mechanical engineering, or any of its subfields, it is mandatory to have knowledge of the engineering process, the programs and tools you use, and so on. If you decide to specialize, you can also get an education for your specific field but most jobs will just require a bachelor in mechanical engineering. <br /><br />


Engineering has always been a hobby of mine. I have enjoyed taking things apart and figuring out how they work ever since I could use tools. I have always enjoyed coming up with ideas of things that I could build with the right parts, and once I learned how to CAD and got a 3d printer, I was able to start making some of the things that I wanted to make. Making things that move was always very cool to me so figuring out that there was a job specifically for that had me excited.<br /><br /><br />

The second career is Robotics engineering. Robotics engineering is a specialization of Mechanical engineering that revolves around the robotics field... obviously. There are two types of robots in the industry. The first is automation robots, which are most your arm robots used in the manufacturing field. The other type is mobile robotics. These are your spot robot dogs from Boston Dynamics, and other robots that look and perform more like something out of a sci-fi film. <br /><br />

Much like mechanical engineers, robotics engineers spend their days CAD’ing, prototyping, assembling, and maintaining robots. Most jobs will have you doing a lot of maintaining, replacing motors and joints when it is needed, and generally being one of the most essential personal to the team, as you are the one who knows how to fix things when they break. <br /><br />

Most jobs in the robotics engineering field take at least a bachelor in Mechanical Engineering. More advanced positions may require either a better education in mechanical engineering, or a degree in robotics engineering. In terms of salary, most robotics engineers make between 60k-120k/year. Of course no entry level engineer will be making 100k+/year, but some of the more senior engineers will.<br /><br />

Now exactly 0.3 of you will be wondering, “how is robotics engineering different from mechanical engineering?” The simple answer is, it mostly is mechanical engineering. Robotics engineering, as I said many times in the other career report, is one of the specializations or subclasses of mechanical engineering. The two jobs spend a lot of time doing the same thing, just to a different outcome.
<br /><br />

In my other report I said how I have always enjoyed engineering, but what really got me onto robotics engineering was my robotics club. During time of writing I am in my 4th year of robotics, and I have really been enjoying it. I am currently the lead engineer and will hopefully stay that way. the program that I do robotics through is FIRST. The robotics club has really allowed me to express my engineering creativity and really put me on a clearer path into engineering and why I enjoyed it.<br />
