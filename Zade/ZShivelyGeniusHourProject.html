						<h2 class="fontcolor">My Driving Question</h2>
						<p class="fontcolor">
							My driving question for this project was, <b><em>How can I transform one of my previous drawings into an animation?</em></b>.<br />
						</p>
						<h2 class="fontcolor">Why I Choose This</h2>
						<p class="fontcolor">
							I choose Animation because I know I want to be an artist of some form but currently I'm open to options.<br />
							For example, I may be a tattoo artist, or I may be an animator. So I have a wide range of options. So here was my thought process, <br />
							I have so many things I could be when I'm older how about I use this project to strike an option down so I can say I've tried it and<br />
							whether or not I liked it. <br />
						</p>
						<h2 class="fontcolor">The Research</h2>
						<p class="fontcolor">I looked at many tutorials to figure out what I would have to do. I looked for things that would explain how to animate and normally explain it very simply,<br />
						so that I may figure out how to use Adobe Character Animate.

						<h4 class="fontcolor">The Problems</h4>
						<p class="fontcolor"> So This wasn't even the actual thing I had been working to make for the whole quarter.<br />
						See I made an animation but It doesn't work with this webpage<br />
						so I had to do some problem solving. I made this with a video creation<br />
						from images that was on my peronal laptop. Since it was my first time using<br />
						that I would say I did pretty well. But the reason why my animation i had<br />
						been working really hard on didn't work is because <b><em>Adobe Media Encoder</em></b> had some<br />
						issues and having 3 days left untill I had to turn in the project did not help.<br />
						The issues it had were the facts that it did not have half of the compatable<br />
						file extentions with a webpage on it. <b><em>Adobe Media Encoder</em></b><br />
						also was not very easy to use and most of the time errors came up and I had no<br />
						idea how to fix them. So once I had gotten something to work and tried to<br />
						put that in my website it did not work. So I had to use this backup.<br />
						Which does not look very bad but is not very long so, it is hard to<br />
						tell whats suposed to be happening in it.<br />
						</p>
						<h5 class="fontcolor">Overveiw</h5>
						<p class="fontcolor">
							Overall, this was a huge challenge but then again I was diving into something new and I knew I was being a bit ambitious after the problems came in. This was supposed<br />
							to test out to see if I would like to major in this, and I think it was a success because I think if I were wanting to, I could now choose animating as a major because I now<br />
							understand it is going to be a lot of work and I may have many problems. If I were to choose this as a major, I would have to understand this and be okay with this. If I would choose this,<br /> 
							I most likely will not use this app to do this again. I will say that I think it is cool and all but, I found it a bit hard to use. I thought what I was going to use was <em>Adobe Flash</em><br />
							which was the then replaced by <em>Adobe Character Animate</em>. Adobe <em>Adobe Flash</em> was a drawing frame-by-frame app and that was what I thought I was going to be using for the Genius Hour Project.<br />
