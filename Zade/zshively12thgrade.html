						<h1 class="fontcolor">Senior Year</h1>
						<h2 class="fontcolor"> Greatest Growth Page</h2>
							<p class="fontcolor"> My greatest growth is confidence. If you asked anyone from my middle school years that knew me,<br />
							they would not recognize me. I found this out the hard way because one of my favorite teachers doesn’t remember me because<br />
							I’ve changed so much. I was super depressed before my senior year and once I’ve gotten most of that gone it was replaced<br />
							with confidence and I will no longer take any undesirable traits. I will use this in my future to be confident in my<br />
							art works and projects I’m doing in my upcoming future. I will also use this in my daily life; something most would think<br />
							as simple I couldn't do before 9th grade: ask for help. whether it was my untreated anxiety or my depression, I thought I<br />
							would just be a bother, but over the years I've grown to think they are there to help and asking never hurts. Standing up for<br />
							myself, whether it be the waitress got my order wrong or someone is being mean to me, I now have the confidence to stand up<br />
							for myself no matter where I am. <br />

						<p class="fontcolor">I have grown in my confidence as proven by my great strides in my engish writing. Including many project I have done in CCP,<br />
						college credit plus, English. This is my Memior project, it was about how I came to love photography and my depression. I was given<br />
						lovely feedback from Ms. Slanker and my peers. I had gotten compliments from her for my way with words and decribing all five senses,<br />
						which was one of the requirments.<br />
						</p>
						<h3 class="fontcolor"> Artifact Two</h3>
						<img src="Images/ZS-Artifact2-10262021.png" alt="A picture of me, in a black shirt with roses on it." width="380" height="480">

						<p class="fontcolor"> This portfolio was hard but now I can say I'm more confident in it that I was when I got this school.This was<br />
						the overwellming project throughout my entire stay at the Dayton Regional S.T.E.M. School. This portfolio is a collection of my years<br />
						here, and my main projects, I have done in the past. I even got a few courses to help me out in the begining. Those classes being the <br />
						STEM Foundations classes in grades 6 and 7.</p>
						<h3 class="fontcolor"> Artifact Three</h3>
						<img src="Images/ZS-Artifact3-10262021.png" alt="A picture of me, in a black shirt with roses on it." width="380" height="480">

						<p class="fontcolor">This is one of my projects in architecture. It was a paper sketch of a Pavilion and it was to shelter things, ie people,<br />
						from the rain while also provide a relaxing place to sit at while outside. It shows my confidence in my creativity. But, it also shows my<br />
						ability to make something look nice while also being functional and have a purpose. It was a project/ assignment called Built Form and Shadows.<br />
						</p>
						<h3 class="fontcolor"> Artifact Four</h3>
						<img src="Images/ZS-Artifact4-10312021.jpg" alt="A picture of me, in a black shirt with roses on it." width="380" height="480">

						<p class="fontcolor"> I have also grown in my confidence in photography. I have greatly inproved in areas such as editing,<br />
						choosing focus areas, and color palettes. I did not do any of this when taking a picture when I first went to school here. <br />
						I can now opperate both phone PRO features and manual cameras. I can take pitcures that look very pleasing to the eye and show<br />
						aesthetics. My favorite one is dark background with something or someone being illuminated by light.</p>
						<h3 class="fontcolor"> Artifact Five</h3>
						<img src="Images/ZS-Artifact5-10312021.jpg" alt="A picture of me, in a black shirt with roses on it." width="380" height="480">
						<img src="Images/ZS-Artifact5-half-10312021.jpg" alt="A picture of me, in a black shirt with roses on it." width="380" height="480"><br />
						<p class="fontcolor"><a href="Images/ZS-Artifact5-10312021.jpg">Download First picture</a><br /> The First Picture</p>
						<p class="fontcolor"><a href="Images/ZS-Artifact5-half-10312021.jpg">Download Second picture</a><br /> The Second Picture</p>
						<p class="fontcolor">As you can see I have clearly grown in self-confidence too. I have a more true smile and <br />
						genuinely laugh more. I am more confident in my appearience and how I present myself. Rather than the picture of<br />
						me below that is from 3 years ago. As you may ovbserve, I don't have long hair anymore. I like long hair but not on me;<br />
						so, I don't think I will get long hair again unless I dye it a bright color.However, I still I don't see myself doing that.<br />
						Like less than one percent of that happening. I don't recongnise the piture with long hair as me. Well not in a way you should<br />
						looking at old pitures. I generally dispise my old pictures with long hair, it's no longer me, and that's okay. :D<br />
