						<h1>9th Grade</h1>
							<p>
								In 9th grade I have done many projects. Below I will tell you about a few of them in my essay.<br />

									<h2 class="fontcolor">Introduction</h2>
									<p class="fontcolor"> 
										I try my best to ask clarifying questions when I really do not understand something. In the beginning<br />
										of 9th grade I thought everything little thing NEEDED to be perfect. Therefore, I did not like asking<br />
										for help. Now, I do not think everything needs to be perfect and I ask for help. I understand that<br />
										sometimes I just need to chill out and not let the stress get to me. For example if it is a week<br />
										before a due date then I do not freak out and just start working. I also have learned some more skills<br />
										to further my life, sometimes stuff just happen but you need to just deal with it and get back up<br />
										again. In 9th grade, I have learned that not everything needs to be perfect; this will help me with<br />
										becoming a sophomore.<br />

									<h2 class="fontcolor">How I Excelled</h2>
										<p class="fontcolor">
											In Chinese, I excelled in the Rap Project. To excel means to do greatly at something.  It was where I had to<br />
											use multiple phrases and words in Chinese and make it into a rap/song. I was doing well in Chinese at the time<br />
											and it was going well. I had a group I was working with to help create it. We had to create a script. After,<br />
											we made the script you would practice it and create a ‘dance’ routine. Then, we all got together and made the<br />
											final video before submitting it. I do not have the final video due to the fact it was not turned in by me,<br />
											but I have the pretest of Chinese and the post-test. You will be able to see that during the year I<br />
											have vastly increased my knowledge of the Chinese language compared to the pretest. We all worked on the><br />
											project and that allowed the end result to be well done.<br />

									<h2 class="fontcolor">How I Struggled</h2>
											<p class="fontcolor">
												 I struggled in Language Art’s Project called, “Post-Apocalyptic Story Project”.  Mainly because I wrote<br />
												 too much and did not want to delete any of it. I had to try hard to delete bits out and figuring out what<br />
												 to keep in the story. First, you created your character and your group decides on where to locate yourselves.<br />
												 Then, we dove head first into shaping and creating their stories. My character was a cool character and was a<br />
												 decent human being unless it came to Oliver. She hates that guy he gets hurt for no apparent reason and her<br />
												 being of the medical background has to fix him up, though if he’s on her nerves too much or this has already<br />
												 happened a lot today she will not help him. Then, in the end, you choose your favorite part and copy it in<br />
												 the final draft. Then do a bunch of proof reading and page editing. In the end, I still kept it the same so<br />
												 I failed to overcome said struggle.  However, if you see my final here, I had done a decent enough job, so<br />
												 when our group’s book was graded we did not do too bad. I believe we all got out of that project with a B or A-.<br />

									<h2 class="fontcolor">How I Grew</h2>
										<p class="fontcolor">
											I grew the most in Engineering in a project called, “The 3D Print Project”. You would have to print an object to help<br />
											solve a problem or issue. I went with a ring holder and used a design like a hand. I found out afterward that apparently<br />
											some people before me failed to do this, while I succeeded. Granted, this project was not a walk in the park, it had many<br />
											problems. In the beginning, I failed it multiple times because I could not figure out a shape to make the rings go on.<br />
											Therefore, after much work and ideas, I used a slightly made up hand, relative to mine (ie: fingers, knuckles, etc...). <br /> 
											As you can see in this beginning of the idea I did not have much way to support the weight of the hand it was just too<br />
											steep of an angle. The first print did not work, for I had filleted (Made it hollow on the inside) the entire thing with<br />
											a program called Autodesk Inventor Professional. Inventor is a software is under the CAD category (computer aided drafting),<br />
											and it lets you make 3D models accurately. Anyways, I filleted it so it would not take up much filament since I still did<br />
											not really know how the filling worked. However, when I started printing it, it came out as spirals of just filament.<br />
											Turns out that you cannot fillet something then print it, because it already filleted it in a way. It uses crisscross<br />
											patterns so the build can be built up and be sturdy. To fix this issue I just deleted the fillet and just like that it<br />
											was working. I started it up and left it on to continue while I was off on break. When break was over, it was finished<br />
											and looked very cool and actually worked really well, to my own surprise. I still use it to this day. This is the outcome<br />
											of this project and I quite like it. I also, like that even though I do not have 10 fingers on it for all the places for<br />
											my rings on each hand. I also like that the outcome does not take up too much space and is still easy to use.<br />

									<h2 class="fontcolor">How I'm Ready For 10th Grade</h2>
									<p class="fontcolor">
										I was like a total nerd in the beginning of the year (still kind of am), but I am a lot more chill now. I really had to rely on inquiry<br />
										because I have had to ask for help a lot this year. I am ready enough for 10th grade because I will at least ask for help when I need<br />
										it and know that not everything has to be perfect. For example, in 1st –beginning 9th grade year (first quarter), I had gotten all A’s<br />
										and B’s. Now, that is totally fine, but I worked excessively hard on my homework and could even say the first draft looked like a final.<br />
										I just spent too much work on something that was only used to test me or to just get an idea out. Now, near the end of 9th grade, I can say<br />
										I most certainly do not do this anymore; I just do not have the time anymore to do that anymore. Therefore, I just have to change it, therefore<br />
										I did. I say ready enough because no one is ever completely ready but I am ready enough to move forward in my life. In 10th grade, I hope I will<br />
										figure out what I want to do career wise.<br />
