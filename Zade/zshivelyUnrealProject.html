							Career Exploration Report
Insert Career Field of Interest<br />
by Z (Zoelle) Shively,Technical Reading & <br />
 Writing, DRSS
ABSTRACT<br />
This report was to show a few options<br />
 to figure out more about the careers and what<br />
 would work best and what wouldnâ€™t work. It was<br />
 also to help figure out how to find these<br />
 things, since they are not normally taught<br />
 in school. The method was to try and find all the<br />
 research before working on the main drafting <br />
 of the essays. The research process starts with<br />
 gathering all information needed, then utilizing <br />
 it in a way that was useful. Next, begin <br />
 on drafting and finalizing the two career options,<br />
 in an essay to formulate the basics of <br />
 said career that has been found from the<br />
 previously acquired research. Research more if not<br />
 enough was found. Find some businesses that<br />
 can be used to help the understanding and mastery<br />
 of said career. Finally, start finalizing everything<br />
 to make it better flow, and then you have<br />
 the completed report. This report explored the <br />
 two career options of being a baker/ pastry<br />
 artist, and the career of a landscape designer.<br />
 This report has given me a few options on which<br />
 internships are available and made some connections;<br />
 however, still currently waiting on a <br />
 response of any kind to be sent back. But there are <br />
 other options, and it would not be hard <br />
 to find many others with a basic<br />
 part of one of the two careers chosen.<br />
