								Hello my name is Zoelle Shively, although I go by Z, and I'm a graduating senior this year!<br />
								After this year will just be a test on whether I want to go to college or just vibe with jobs<br />
								and not college debt. It will be like a trial for real life: just for living life with a job and no<br />
								school. If I decide I want to go to college I will. For example, I saw that Sinclair has a metal working<br />
								class thats for a year and that really interests me. But otherwise, I'm not going to college right out of high school.<br />
								</p>
							<p class="fontcolor">
								In my portfolio, you will find many things I have worked on while I have been at the <b>Dayton Regional STEM School</b>.<br />
								I will have <b>artifacts</b> to show evidence of the things I did throughout my years here, at STEM.<br /> 
								I will also have a brief summary to explain what happened and what the <b>artifacts represent</b> on their own pages.<br />
							</p>
							<h3 class="fontcolor">Getting to Know Z</h3>
								<p class="fontcolor">
									A few things that are a key point in myself are, I love video games and love doing art pieces. In addition, I also enjoy hanging out with my friends.<br />
									While it has not been the easiest in these times, I hold dearly the memories we had together. I wish you all well, and to have a lovely day!<br />
								</p>
