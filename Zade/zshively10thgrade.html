										<h3 class="fontcolor"> Patience with Math</h3>
									</a>
											<p class="fontcolor">
												Over this semester, I have overcome a challenge brought with learning math called patience; this has come after many assignments of not understanding.<br />
												I have learned this from many assignments and/or projects in many classes however, I feel as though that has been excessively so for math this year. While<br />
												math has not always been the hardest subject, it definitely has become it. And yes, while I have learned from it, it doesn’t mean it’s entirely over.<br />
												I have overcome a few thing in math, yes, but I have not overcome math itself completely yet. I think that will take many years. <br />
											</p>
												<p class="fontcolor">
													One of the assignments was Factoring Quadratic Functions. In math, we use a website that is supposed to help us become better at it. This website is<br />
													called IXL and while I understand its purpose, I do not always understand it. Which in itself has been a problem that has not been fixed yet. However,<br />
													IXL has always particularly difficult for me. Others have some troubles with it because one of the two participants of the action of getting the answer wrong.<br /> 												
													</p>
														<p class="fontcolor">
															The lessons and notes of Math class itself do not help much either. The notes or worksheet is more of copy down the notes fast enough rather than actually<br />
															learning what the lesson is. This makes me fall behind sometimes. The lecture does not always make sense to me so I have to find outside resources to help me<br />
															understand the lesson. Some of these include, more knowledgeable friends, YouTube, the internet, etc…<br />
														</p>
													<p class="fontcolor">
														On the Reference Triangles and Reciprocal Trig Functions Worksheet, we did some lessons. Then we were taught how to find triangles sides, and angles. For triangles’<br />
														sides we used either two sides and an angle or an angle and two sides. For triangles’ angles, we used two angles or sides and an angle/ two. However, I still did not<br />
														understand how to do them, and even when I asked for help, the help I got did not help. It is not the teachers fault; I just know what type of help I necessarily needed.<br />
														It turns out I needed step by step, hands on, visual learning. <br />
													</p>
												<p class="fontcolor">
													Also on the Graph Quadratic Functions in Standard Form Worksheet, I had some troubles on. I never have been great at graphing things in math. This worksheet is one that can,<br />
													and has definitely proves this statement. I still do not fully understand how to do it. Nevertheless, we get better from practice and practice I have. But, at that time,<br />
													I did not understand it and did not do great on the assignment. <br />
												</p>
											<p class="fontcolor">
												Finally, I have done my best in this class and with doing so have learned from it. Patience is a necessity in life. If you are hasty and are impatient,<br />
												then in life you will be rewarded with anger, and who wants to be angry their entire life. If you have learned patience, in your most frustrating situations,<br />
												you can have a calm outlook on it and eventually it may come to you. Learning takes time, patience and acceptance. It may be awhile before you get it or you may<br />
												get it in a jiffy. <br />
