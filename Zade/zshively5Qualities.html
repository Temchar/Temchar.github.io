					<h1 class="fontcolor">5 Qualities</h1>
	
								<p class="fontcolor">
									You're probably wondering what are the 5 Qualities, So the five qualities are Inquiry, Persistence, collaboration, <br />
									communication, and creativity.  
								</p>
								<p class="fontcolor">
									The quality I have grown most in this year is Communication because I have communicated with alot of people this<br />
									year and have given insight into me more with teachers and others.
								</p>
								<h2 class="fontcolor"><em>Inquiry</em></h2>
								<img class="photo" src="Images/InquiryImage.jpg" alt="Inquiry of a brain" width="406" height="308">
								<div class="text"><p class="top-left"><b>Inquiry happening in the brain</b></p></div>
									<div class="bottom-left"><cite class="AnothaColor">"Free Image on Pixabay - Brain, Mind, Ok, Question,<br />
									Zen." Free illustration: Brain, Mind,<br />
										Ok, Question, Zen - Free Image on Pixabay <br />
										- 962588. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Apr. 2017.<br /><br /></div>
									</cite>
							  </div>
									<p class="fontcolor"> 
										The first quality is Inquiry; <em>Inquiry</em> is asking questions to help further your knowledge. I use this in classes to figure out many things.
										Such as in Pre-calculus; I ask many questions to get a better understanding of the topic to further my knowledge and to pass the class.
										
									</p>
									
									<h2 class="fontcolor"><em>Persistence</em></h2>
										<img class="right" src="Images/PersistenceImage.jpg" alt="Persistence in grass" width="429" height="323">
							<div class="text"><p class="AnothaColor"><b>Persistence in grass</b></p></div>
							<br />
														<br />

								<p class="fontcolor"><cite class="citations">
									<b>Bk. "Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass,
									I can appreciate persistence." Flickr.<br />
									Yahoo!, 18 Oct. 2013. Web. 21 Apr. 2017.</b><br />
								</cite></p>
							</div>
										<pclass="fontcolor> 
											The next quality is Persistence; <em>Persistence</em> is when you keep going. You push through all the problems<br />
												and make it out in the end. For example when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, my school adapted and kept working<br />
												through everything to ensure the students still got their education. <br />
										</p>
										
										<h2 class="fontcolor"><em>Collaboration</em></h2>
											<img class="photo" src="Images/CollaberationImage.png" alt="People helping solve a problem with collaboration" width="429" height="323">
					<div class="textLeft"><b>People helping solve a problem with collaboration</b></div>
											<cite class="citations"><b>"Free Image on Pixabay - Business, Collaboration."

											</cite>
										</div>
											<p class="fontcolor">
												Then we have Collaboration; <em>Collaboration</em> is working together, with people you may or may not know. It's team work.<br />
												It is simular to a time in my US Goverment class where I had to work together t=with someone I had not spoken to, to create a document,<br />
												based on topics and our biases together.<br />
											</p>
										
											<h2><em>Communication</em></h2>
												<img class="right" src="Images/CummunicationImage.jpg" alt="A speaker channeling their message to the receivers, Communicating" width="429" height="323">
				<div class="textLeft"><b>A speaker channeling their message to the receivers,<br /> Communicating</b></div>

									20 Apr. 2017. Web. 21 Apr. 2017.</b>
							</cite>
							  </div>
												<p>
													After that, we have communication. <em>Communication</em> is using a language to tell your thoughts out loud. It can be verbal or non-verbal, <br />
													as long as the person&#40;s&#41; you are trying to tell understand. An example is when I did not talk much to many people out side of my close friend group<br />
													but this year I have spoken to more people outside of my group and have made new friends.<br />
												</p>
												
												<h2><em>Creativity</em></h2>
													<img class="photo" src="Images/CreativityImage.jpg" alt="Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing witch ones to keep." width="429" height="323"><br />
					<div class="left"><b>Creative Quote</b></div><br />
											<cite class="citations"> <b>Twentyfour Students "Creativity Poster 1 - Andrea." Flickr. Yahoo!,<br />
													18 Jan. 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2017.</b>  </cite>
								</div>
													<p>
														Finally we have creativity, <em>Creativity</em> is having vast ideas that are mainly origional or new. That can be in art, or in engeneering.<br />
														both require ideas and engeneering requires problem solving to create something that will do what they want it to. This year in Engeneering Sustainability,<br />
														we had to come up with solutions for helping developing contries create electricity from renewable resources.
