					throughout this whole year,and it has really helped<br />
					me through these hard times. I have been practicingit<br />

								<img  src="Images/ZShalfOfAf24162021.PNG" alt="Z's Enviormental Sustainability Grades before, for an assignment and their grades now." width="350" height="500">

		
					<p class="right">In this photo you can see when<br />
					I did the assignment it was not the<br />
					best grade and the class grade is a <br />
					B instead of a F. This was<br />
					Enviormental Sustainability.<br />

					<p class="right">These are my grades on the<br />
					CER assignment, in my English<br />
					class: called Technical, Reading, <br />

							<img  src="Images/ZS-BluePenEye.jpg" alt="Z's English Grades before, for an assignment and their grades now." width="350" height="500">
					
				<p class="right"> This is an eye. I made it with a blue pen in school.<br />
									I like drawing eyes as they are a complex organ thus making it<br />
									more difficult to make it realistic. I also like how eyes contain<br />
									many emotions and you can be super creative with eyes and what the <br />
									inside looks like, such as the pupil, iris, and sclera.<br />
