			<h2 class="fontcolor"> Internship</h2>
			     <img src="Images/FirstDayOf.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> This first picture shows me on the first day of my internship.<br />
				I dressed up alot for it, later I had figured out I didn't need to be that proffessional. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/stool.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> This is a stool. Hahhaha. Behind it shows the bags of flour and<br />
				freshly cleaned counter. They were made of metal so it was easier to clean and didn't contaminate anything.<br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/weigh.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> I had to weigh everything in kg other than the buckets of flour she sold.<br />
				I learned to know the scale's rythem and even though I had to clean under the sticker for the keypad it worked. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/packaging.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> These are bags with brown sugar, flour mix, and chocolate chips we put together.<br />
				I love using the hot wire to seal it. It made a nice sound. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/mixer.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> This is actually a cememnt mixer with a large container on top.<br />
				It was alot cheaper than what a large big mixer actually made to do it is. We put in about 12kg in it.<br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/flour.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> We used rolly trash bins to store the flour (don't worry it was clean).<br />
				I dressed up alot for it, later I had figured out I didn't need to be that proffessional. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/bags of flour.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> This is where she stored her extra bags of flour.<br />
				We went through a lot together during my internship there.<br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/potatoflourcloseup.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> This is potato flour, it was a part of her custom mix of gluten free flour<br />
				There was a stinky flour too;I think it started with an 'e' or a 'x'. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/GodFlour.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> I had gotten flour all over my black pants.<br />
				It's safe to say I never wore black pants to do internship hours again. <br />
				</p>
				<img src="Images/floureverywhere.jpg" alt="Z's Internship... probably flour" width="350" height="500">
				<p class="fontcolor"> Let me tell you about flour... it get's everywhere.<br />
				I quickly learned to noy wear anything very nice when I did my internship. I was also on sweeping duty. <br />
