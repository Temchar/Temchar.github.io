						<p class="fontcolor">
								I think I overall grew in Inquiry, not just in work but in my art too. When I started<br />
							I was not that good at knowing if I should change it, add to it, or keep it the same. This includes    <br />
							both my school work and  my art work.
						</p>
							<p class="fontcolor"> 
									But then again I also think I grew in persistence, this also incudes both school<br />
								and art work. You have to have persistence to do both. You need persistence when your feel like<br />
								giving up, so you can keep on trying. You need this when things are not going right. Such as a school<br />
								paper or a unfinished idea. All you have to do is <b>try</b>. Try again and again until its the way you<br />
								like it. Not every piece  of art work, script, video, is flawless. All great work take time, patience,<br />
								persistence, and creativity. No work is good if all you do is copy. It's good to start out but you<br />
								shouldn't do this forever.

						<h3 class="fontcolor">Frustration in Fitness</h3>
					<p class="fontcolor">
							Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights activist,<br />
						once said,” If you can’t fly, then run, If you can’t run, then walk, If you can’t walk, then crawl,<br />
						But whatever you do, You have to keep moving forward.” In this I used persistence when I<br />
						felt like giving up but didn’t, I kept moving forward like Martin Luther King Jr. did. He tried and<br />
						tried to get a future where all people would be treated equally and would get<br />
						the same rights, and he was successful by preserving. Persistence is when you feel as though giving<br />
						up but instead you keep going. This year I have improved in the<br />
						quality of persistence, which has helped me become more skilled in cardiovascular endurance.
					</p>
						
						<p class="fontcolor">
							In this task I have grown in persistence, which has helped me become better at<br />
						cardiovascular endurance. Cardiovascular endurance is jogging, walking, and skipping, it’s basically<br />
						stamina. For this task we started off continuously jogging for gym. As it got later in the year the time we<br />
						had to continuously jog increased by half a minute every two weeks, which made it get harder and harder till<br />
						it reached the point where I was like “HOW?!?” or “How can you go any longer?!?”This was because I’m not someone<br />
						who’s good at continuously working out. So this is where persistence comes in, when you feel like giving up and<br />
						feel as though it’s impossible but keep going. When I got to three minutes for the continuous jog I thought to myself: <br />
						“HOW?!?” Because I felt I reached my limit, though right now we are on five minutes and counting and I <em>still</em> have<br />
						not reached my limit. But through persistence I have made it through five and a half minutes of continuously jogging.<br />
						The time is continuously increasing by 30 seconds every 2 weeks. Yes, it took time, effort, and practice but I made it!<br />
						A helpful tip that helped me make it was controlled breathing. Controlled Breathing was while you were jogging you<br /> 
						would breathe in through your nose hold it for a few seconds and then exhale it through your mouth. This is supposed<br />
						to help you keep oxygen in you so you don’t collapse from lack of oxygen. This helped a lot as the times of continuously<br />
						jogging got longer. After Jogging we would do exercises or games. To keep track of our data we had Fitness charts.<br />
						In the fitness charts we‘d keep the date played, RPE, and heartrate throughout the activity. RPE is a scale to rate<br />
						ratio for how hard you worked. For example: 1 would be like, “oh my god, I could do this in my sleep”, and 10 would<br />
						be like “HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?!? IT’S SOO HARD!” RPE stands for Rate of Perceived Exertion.  As you can see from the<br />
						beginning of the Fitness chart, we did a walk/jog, the walk/jog dated as 10/7/16 was really hard because I personally<br />
						am not super active, and so I had a harder start. But as time passes we can see a slight difference in the newer chart,<br />
						the walk/jog dated as 2/23/17, and the numbers for RPE goes down a bit and the heart rate becomes more of a regular number.<br />
						But after Christmas break the activities gets harder, because Mrs. Curran increased the complexity of the game, so as we get<br />
						better at cardiovascular endurance we don’t stop getting a work out.
						</p>

									Since I have grown at the quality persistence, I have improved to become better at<br />
								cardiovascular endurance. In this portfolio you can see how I felt like giving up but instead I<br />
								practiced with time and effort to become better at cardiovascular endurance. It is important I<br /> 
								improved in this quality because this has helped me understand that if you do something enough and<br />
								push yourself, you can do it no matter how hard it may be.

				<h3 class="fontcolor">Questioning Myself</h3><!--Put in revised draft when finished-->
				
					<p class="fontcolor">	
						Albert Einstein, a scientist, once said, “The important thing is to not stop questioning.”<br />
						In these DBQ's I had to use inquiry to keep on questioning myself. Inquiry is when you are asking questions<br />
						and/or are trying to get an answer. We had to use our previous knowledge and effectively pull evidence from<br />
						the documents. Like Albert, I always have to keep questioning myself to make sure I have everything I need.<br />
						This year, I have improved in the quality of inquiry, which has helped me to become more skilled at writing skills<br />
						in World History.  

					</p>
						<p class="fontcolor">
							In this activity, I grown in inquiry, which has helped me become more skilled at questioning<br />
							my work from DBQ’s. In World History we answer DBQ’s. DBQ means Document Based Question. These questions<br />
							are meant to tie into the subject you are working on at that time. DBQ’s require a claim, effective use of<br />
							your document, prior knowledge, evidence, how much you have on the page, and little to no writing errors.<br />
							In one of my older DBQ’s I forgot to pull evidence from the documents for the difference. In this case I<br />
							forgot to question if I have all the requirements. In this DBQ we were to compare similarities and differences<br />
							between the ancient Greek Olympics to modern day Olympics. The ancient and modern Olympics are sporting events<br />
							that require skill. For example in the older Olympics they would do Chariot races but instead we do horse races.<br />
							In one of my newer DBQ’s I have all of the requirements. I wrote a lot and questioned enough that I had done<br />
							everything needed to get full points. This one talks about the Magna Carta compared to the bill of rights. The<br />
							Magna Carta is a list of laws the president can’t deprive of us, and The Bill of Rights is a list that has been<br />
							written for individual purposes and limits the government, that he/she can’t pass. The Magna Carta has less<br />
							specific laws than the Bill of Rights. But the Manga Carta was made before the Bill of Rights, in fact, the<br />
							Magna Carta was the first act of rights to civilians. 

						</p>
							<p class="fontcolor">
								Since I have inproved in the quality of inquiry, I am better able to question myself. It<br />
								is important you enhance this quality because it helps you make something better than it already was.<br />
								For example if you got feedback on something, say art, you would most likely do better than if you didn't<br />
								get feedback.
